          I went to GSMST because I heard they had a very successful VEX Robotics team, and I was hoping to get in. Upon joining the club, they organized a competition for the freshman to decide who gets to be placed on a team because so many people wanted to join our robotics club. My team won this mini competition, which I would be surprised if we didn’t because nobody in my grade was even close to my level at VEX. </p>
            <p>This was the 2024-2025 VEX season and the game is shown here:

          <div id = "materials"></v><h1  style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 30px;">Pre-Joining</h1>
            <p>An upperclassman named Logan who was on 675C came up to me and told me that I could join any team I wanted to, so I asked which was the best team in the school, and he said 675C. So I joined. 
</p>
            <p>Before I joined the team, the rest of my teammates who are all higher grades than I am already worked on the bot over the summer. The first bot concept was named Wall-E, through the design on this robot, the team was able get a start on how to manipulate the game elements.
 
            </p>
            <p>Whilst still in the summer, the team made Wall-E v2. I don’t really know much about this robot since I didn’t get to participate in the team yet.

          <div id = "building"><h1  style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 30px;">Funding</h1>
          <p>A huge problem with VEX or any robotics in general is that it is very, very expensive, so we had to find funding. One of the ways was the Viet Moon Fest in Duluth, where we showcased our robots in hopes there would be people who donated. We did end up getting some donations. The details of the moon festival can be viewed on page 200 and 201. At the moon festival, I helped setup and represent 675C.

              I wont be going over the designing of the robot, because there is just way too much to cover, as well as, everything is documented in our logbook (link above).

          <div id = "postbuild"><h1  style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 30px;">Worlds</h1>
          <p>In May 2025, our team went to VEX worlds in Dallas, Texas. I took a plane to Dallas where I met up with my team. I had a BNB in the LTV tower, while some of the my other teammates had the school book them into the Adolphus Hotel. We worked on the bot at their hotel mostly, and during the days where we competed, we were at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center. Those three days were very stressful because there was a still a lot of problems or inconsistencies on our bot as well as with the code. In the end, we didn’t achieve as much as we wanted to.</p>

                    <p>Update: Our school announced that the VEX program at our school is dissolved. Very disappointing for everyone.
